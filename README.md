# Adaptive-(Chi-Gravity)XG Project

This repository contains the research series **Adaptive-(Chi-Gravity)XG**, which proposes a new gravitational framework as an alternative to dark matter and dark energy, while also curing singularities.

The project is organized into three main papers:

---

## ðŸ“„ Paper I
**Title:** Galactic Dynamics and Lensing without Dark Matter  
**DOI:** [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17042264) | [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30047671)  
**Folder:** [Paper1](./Paper1)  

Introduces the Adaptive-(Chi-Gravity)XG framework and applies it to galactic rotation curves and lensing without cold dark matter.

## ðŸ“„ Paper II
**Title:** Master Equation, Horizons, Early Galaxies, and New Tests  
**DOI:** [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17058164) | [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30058042)  
**Folder:** [Paper2](./Paper2)  

Derives the full Master Equation, showing singularity resolution and explaining high-redshift galaxies (z â‰ˆ 6â€“10) without dark matter.

## ðŸ“„ Paper III
**Title:** Cosmology, Forecasts, and Falsifiability  
**DOI:** [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17061587) | [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30060904)  
**Folder:** [Paper3](./Paper3)  

Extends Adaptive-XG into cosmology, testing consistency with SN Ia, BAO, CMB, and weak-lensing data. Provides forecasts for Euclid, LSST, CMB-S4, LISA, and pulsars, making the framework predictive and falsifiable.
